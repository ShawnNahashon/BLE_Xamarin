# BLE_Xamarin
Example Code for projects for Xamarin with Bluetooth Low Energy. In my examples I will be using the LightBlue Bean by Punch Through

The projects I post here will be a series of weekend projects with Xamarin and the Lightblue Bean by Punch Through. 
While the focus of these projects/tutorials is to get Xamarin users started with their BLE device, I hope the projects will be fun
and teach users how to integrate different types of electrical components into their own projects.

# Do Not Forget
For Android users, do not forget to change your target API in the AndroidManifest file to that of the device you are using.
