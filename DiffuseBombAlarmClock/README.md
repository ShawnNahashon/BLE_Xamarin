#Diffuse Bomb Alarm Clock

#Introduction
Have trouble getting out of bed? Make yourself one of these! Set an alarm the night before and put the Lightblue Bean alarm
mechanism away from your bed. When its time to get up your phone will connect to your BLE alarm mechanism causing the speaker to ring. On your phone will appear the instructions to disarm the annoying sound. Once the proper combination of cut and 
uncut wires is achieved the app will disconnect from the BLE alarm mechanism and the ringing will stop! 

#Purpose
This is a fun tutorial that incorporates Bluetooth Low Energy Xamarin functionality of receiving data from scratch 
characteristics as well as some basic microcontroller functionality (such as using GPIOs for digital read/write purposes).

The main purpose is to deomnstrate how to make a simple Cross Platform App with a BLE device in Xamarin. 

#Reminders
Make sure you clean the solution before using it.
